The data files `ffl?_*.mat` in this folder are generated by the code in `data_processing` and saved in the folder `data_processing/ffl?/4-mergeRegions_and_findCriticalIterations_and_numberOfUniqueUpgrades/results`. To generate these data files, the script in each subfolder of `data_processing/ffl?` can be run in sequence, copying the generated files in the `results` subfolder into the `data` subfolder of the next one.
